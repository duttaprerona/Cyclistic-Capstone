Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n\nUntil now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\n### 1.2 Business Objective and Expected Results\nThe main business objective in this case is to discover how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Both the Director of Marketing as well as finance analysts have concluded that annual members are more profitable. \n\nTherefore, results from this analysis will be used to provide reccomendations that can help the marketing team come up with strategies to increase annual members.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"Prepare\"></a>\n# **Step 2: Prepare**\nIn this step, the data being used and its sources are identified.\n\n### 2.1 Data Information\nThe datasets used for this analysis has been made available by Motivate International Inc.

There are more Member bike users in comparison to Casual bike users.\n2. Casual users were found to take longer trips or rides on average than Annual Members.This could mean that casual users rented Cyclistic bikes for leisure.\n3. Casual users often ride on weekends whereas Members use the bikes more over the week than on weekends. This could indicate that annual Members are using the bikes to commute to work. Additionally, both casual and annual members commonly rent the bike on Saturdays.\n4. Rides may be influenced by weather with July, August, September having the highest number of riders.\n5. Docked bike is the most preferred type of ride among both users followed by electric bike.\n\n### **Recommendations**\nThe following recommendations might encourage Casual riders to upgrade to annual membership thus increasing revenue and profits at Cyclistic bike-share:\n* Offer a discount for users who take long rides or discounts based on certain distance.\n* Introduce a weekend only membership that costs less than the current weekly membership.\n* Create more campaigns around summer months and offer coupons/discounts on winter months to encourage more riders.","metadata":{}}]}
